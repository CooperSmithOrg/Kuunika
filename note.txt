no group approval process or workflow -- need concurrency
more git than google docs in terms of collaboration
flag issues and submit resolutions to be approved by admin (accepted or rejected)
ability to add data model update suggestions to a central queue, private views
ability to prevent multiple/duplicative requests to alter data model
ability to follow threads/requests/data reconciliation processes (subscribe)
authentication process, appear seamless to DHIS2 tool usage

--------------
Data ingestion
  Basic data cleaning (strip extra whitespace, column and row awareness, etc)
  Ability to establish connection to server/table
  Field selection (to import portions of a table or spreadsheet)
  Column mappings / rename / data type selection(?)

Sign-in
  Oauth/DHIS2 user login to mirror privileges of existing tool (dhis2)

VIEW
Visual Rendering
  Establish baseline aesthetic for displaying information
  Depict metadata attributes (field ID, source, associations, who or what generated it/ collects it/ uses it)
  Depict connections between objects (graph/nodes) [see https://linkurio.us/]
  Ability to show other users, their privileges/roles, contact channel (chat or email, in or outside of app)
--  Deconflict user perspective of fields that are potentially duplicative but outside user's domain/role
  Profile page for roles, Admin page for assigning roles and adding users
  Iconography/badging for depicting user attributes (is the person an admin, do they work with HIV, are they a doc, etc.)
  Present & Future-state of data model (how it exists currently vs how it would look with users edits approved)
  Depiction of current vs newly added fields in a way that's clear (ie this field does or does not exist yet in DHIS2)

Deconfliction & metadata adjudication
  Process for submitting recommended changes/issues to a committee or relevant administrative group
  Flag data model issues/ suggestions to a central queue (with compartmentalized views according to user privileges)
  Prevent multiple/duplicative requests from competing for approval on same issue simultaneously
  Subscription/follow functionality so users can follow data issues through the adjudication process, alerts for progress (github stars)
  Ability to translate a users visual mappings into DHIS2 alterations(?) DHIS2 <--> Metadata-Nav
