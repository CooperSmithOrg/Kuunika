"Every child is expected to be fully immunised by his/her first birthday. A child has to have BCG, OPV-3, DPT - HepB-Hib 3, PCV – 3, Rota – 2 and Measles 1 vaccinations in order to be fully immunised. To calculate this indicator, all children who are under 1 on the date of last dose of vaccination (measles 1) have to be aggregated as numerator for the specified period."
